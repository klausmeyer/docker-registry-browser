> **NOTE**:
>
> With this version the way how docker images are pushed is changing slightly:
> Instead of having the `latest` tag being updated on every (potentially) breaking commit merged
> into `master` branch it will be pointing to the last officially published release.
>
> You can switch to the `master` tag if you want to get the newest (unreleased) changes.
